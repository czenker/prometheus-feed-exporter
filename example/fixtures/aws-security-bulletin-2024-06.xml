&lt;p&gt;A security researcher recently reported an issue with AWS’s recently-released (November 16th, 2022) support for multiple multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices for IAM user principals. The reported issue could have potentially arisen only when the following three conditions were met: (1) An IAM user had possession of long-term access key (AK)/secret key (SK) credentials, (2) that IAM user had the privilege to add an MFA to their own identity without using an MFA, and (3) that IAM user’s overall access privileges beyond console sign-in had been configured by an administrator to be greater after adding the MFA. Under those narrow conditions, possession of AK/SK alone was equivalent to possession of AK/SK and a previously configured MFA.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While IAM users with the ability to add or delete an MFA device associated with their own identity have always been able to do so solely with AK/SK credentials, an issue arose when the new feature was combined with the self-management by IAM users of their own MFA devices, with restricted access prior to an MFA being added by the user. This self-management pattern was documented &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_aws_my-sec-creds-self-manage.html"&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that page included a sample IAM policy for implementing the pattern. The combination of the new multi-MFA feature created an inconsistency with that approach. Given the new feature, a user with only AK/SK credentials could add an additional MFA without using a previously-configured MFA, thus allowing possession of AK/SK alone without a previously configured MFA to potentially gain broader access than expected by customers using the sample policy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This issue did not affect AWS Management Console-based access, since an existing MFA is always required at sign-in. Nor did it affect federated principals, who manage MFA through their identity provider.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As of April 21, 2023, the identified issue has been remediated by requiring that IAM users who already have one or more MFAs and who use AK/SK credentials to manage their own MFA devices to first use sts:GetSessionToken and an existing MFA to obtain MFA-enabled temporary credentials to sign their CLI commands or API requests prior to enabling or disabling MFA devices for themselves. We have directly notified a very small number of customers via their Personal Health Dashboard who had previously associated an additional MFA device using a mechanism other than the AWS Management Console. We recommended that those notified customers confirm the correctness of their MFA configurations. No further customer action is required.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank researchers at MWR Cybersec for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue to AWS. Security-related questions or concerns can be brought to our attention via &lt;a href="mailto:aws-security@amazon.com"&gt;&lt;b&gt;aws-security@amazon.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 14:03:37 +0000</pubDate><category/><author>aws@amazon.com</author></item><item><link>https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-003/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5d0119c25827fef44449cc716227585502c46585</guid><title>CVE-2024-28056</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publication Date:&amp;nbsp;2024/04/15 07:00 AM PST&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;AWS is aware of CVE-2024-28056, which affects Amplify CLI versions prior to 12.10.1 and Amplify Studio, which uses Amplify CLI. We released a fix to Amplify CLI on January 10, 2024 that also fixed Amplify Studio, and recommend customers upgrade to Amplify CLI 12.10.1 or higher to address this issue. We have proactively communicated with the customers using affected versions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;AWS has taken two additional steps to protect customers using Amplify from unintentional misconfigurations. First, AWS added a mitigation to the AWS Security Token Service (STS) where attempts to make a cross-account role assumption with a trust policy referencing Amazon Cognito as the trusted principal, without conditions to scope down access to specific Amazon Cognito Identity Pools using the aud claim, will fail. As a result, cross-account access will no longer be possible with policies created by earlier unpatched versions of Amplify. Second, AWS added a mitigation to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) control plane such that any attempt to create a role trust policy that references Amazon Cognito as the trusted principal, without adding conditions restricting access, will fail. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank Datadog for responsibly disclosing this issue to AWS.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Please email &lt;a href="mailto:aws-security@amazon.com"&gt;aws-security@amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; with any security questions or concerns.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 00:33:27 +0000</pubDate><category/><author>aws@amazon.com</author></item><item><link>https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-002/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">2753d2d610c5e18f3b8be7332ee05bd2b426980c</guid><title>CVE-2024-3094</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publication Date:&amp;nbsp;2024/03/29 12:30 PM PST&lt;br&gt; CVE Identifier: CVE-2024-3094&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;AWS is aware of CVE-2024-3094, which affects versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of the xz-utils package. This issue may attempt to introduce security issues in openssh through the use of liblzma within some operating system environments. Amazon Linux customers are not affected by this issue, and no action is required. AWS infrastructure and services do not utilize the affected software and are not impacted. Users of Bottlerocket are not affected.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Customers using other operating systems are advised to refer to information provided by the OS vendor to address any concerns originating from this reported issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finch&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;An updated version of runc is available for Finch in the latest release, v1.1.0. Customers should upgrade their Finch installation on macOS to address this issue. Finch releases can be downloaded through the project's GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/runfinch/finch/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;release page&lt;/a&gt; or by running "brew update" if you installed Finch via Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AWS Deep Learning AMI&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The affected runc package is a part of our Amazon Linux 2 Deep Learning AMI. This runc package is pulled from upstream Amazon Linux 2 releases. Deep Learning AMI will automatically consume the latest patched package once it becomes available from the Amazon Linux Team. Once released, affected customers will need to pull in the latest Deep Learning AMI to consume the latest runc updates to mitigate the issue.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AWS Batch&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;An updated Amazon ECS Optimized AMI as the default Compute Environment AMI is available. As a general security best practice, we recommend that Batch customers replace their existing Compute Environments with the latest AMI. Instructions for replacing the Compute Environment are available in the Batch product &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html#managed_compute_environments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Batch customers who do not use the default AMI should contact their operating system vendor for the updates necessary to address these issues. Instructions for Batch custom AMI are available in the Batch product &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/create-batch-ami.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;AWS&amp;nbsp;is aware of CVE-2024-37902, relating to a potential issue with the archive extraction utilities for DeepJavaLibrary (DJL). On May 15, 2024, we released version 0.28.0 to address this issue. If you are using an affected version (0.1.0 through 0.27.0), we recommend you upgrade to 0.28.0 or higher.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;For&amp;nbsp;additional information, please refer to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;DJL release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;AWS&amp;nbsp;is aware of an issue with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/vm-import/" target="_self"&gt;VM Import Export Service&lt;/a&gt; (VMIE). On April 12, 2024, we addressed this issue and can confirm new Windows OS imports are not affected.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;When&amp;nbsp;using the EC2 VMIE service to import a VM using Windows OS, customers can optionally use their own Sysprep answer file. Before April 12, 2024, the EC2 VMIE service had an issue where, if a customer imported a VM using Windows OS to use as an AMI or instance, then an identical backup copy of the answer file would be created without sensitive data being removed if included in the file. This backup file is only accessible to on-instance Windows users who had permission to access the customer-provided answer file.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;For&amp;nbsp;customers who used the EC2 VMIE service in this manner, we recommend checking for a file name ending with .vmimport in the following locations, which are associated with Sysprep:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul style="font-family: courier;"&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);"&gt;C:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);"&gt;C:\Windows\Panther\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);"&gt;C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);"&gt;C:\Windows\system32\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: rgb(240,240,240);"&gt;C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\Panther\Unattend\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Once&amp;nbsp;you identify the .vmimport file, restrict access to necessary user accounts or remove the backup file completely on the imported EC2 instance(s) or instance(s) launched from an affected AMI. Completing either of these actions will not affect the functionality of the EC2 instance. Because new EC2 instances launched using an affected AMI will be affected by this issue, we recommend customers delete the affected AMI and create a new AMI using the EC2 VM Import Export (VMIE) Service to re-import the virtual machine, or use the EC2 API/Console to create a new AMI from the EC2 instance where the fix has been applied.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;No&amp;nbsp;action is required for users who had scoped down access to the Sysprep answer file before using EC2 VMIE Service to import the Windows OS or have used EC2 VMIE Service after April 12, 2024, to import Windows OS with/without Sysprep answer file in any AWS region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;AWS&amp;nbsp;is aware of the issues described in CVE-2024-37293, relating to the open-source AWS Deployment Framework (ADF). These issues affect the bootstrap process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges. We have addressed this issue in version 4.0 and above. We recommend that customers upgrade to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/releases/tag/v4.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;latest version&lt;/a&gt; immediately to help ensure defense in depth.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As a temporary mitigation, we recommend adding a &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;permissions boundary&lt;/a&gt; to the roles created by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create, manage, and bootstrap accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
